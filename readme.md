# üí≥ Credit Card Classification

**Project File: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13DOJCDslfcL0n_dKrw_YbMTUdBRJe2gR?usp=sharing**

This project implements a **classification model using Logistic Regression** to determine whether a user is eligible for a credit card.  
The model leverages the following features:  

- **Annual Income**  
- **Age**  
- **Employment Status**  
- **Family Members**

## üöÄ Roadmap of Machine Learning Project  

This project follows a standard end-to-end machine learning pipeline:  

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- Import datasets (`Credit_card.csv`, `Credit_card_label.csv`).  
- Merge features with labels for supervised learning.  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- Handle missing values through imputation/removal.  
- Remove duplicates and inconsistencies.  
- Standardize/normalize numerical features (`Annual_Income`, `Age`).  
- Encode categorical variables (`Employment_Status`).  

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualize distributions of features.  
- Analyze correlations and relationships with the target variable.  
- Identify outliers and assess class balance.  

### 4. **Feature Engineering**  
- Derive new features if necessary.  
- Apply scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler).  
- Use Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding for categorical data.  

### 5. **Splitting the Dataset**  
- Train-Test split (commonly 80:20).  
- Use stratified splitting if class distribution is imbalanced.  

### 6. **Model Building (Logistic Regression)**  
- Train Logistic Regression with appropriate solver.  
- Adjust hyperparameters such as regularization (`C`).  

### 7. **Model Evaluation**  
Evaluate performance with multiple metrics:  
- **Accuracy** ‚Äì overall model correctness.  
- **Precision** ‚Äì ratio of correctly predicted eligible users among predicted eligible.  
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** ‚Äì ratio of correctly predicted eligible users among actual eligible.  
- **F1-Score** ‚Äì balance between precision and recall.  
- **ROC-AUC Curve** ‚Äì measure of class separation ability.  

### 8. **Model Validation**  
- Apply k-fold cross-validation for robustness.  
- Compare Logistic Regression with baseline models (Decision Trees, Random Forest).  

### 9. **Deployment (Future Scope)**  
- Save the trained model (`joblib`/`pickle`).  
- Deploy with **Flask/Django REST API**.  
- Build a lightweight frontend UI for real-time predictions.
